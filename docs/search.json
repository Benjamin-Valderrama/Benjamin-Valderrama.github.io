    "text": "The South American Microbiome Archive\n\n\nCNN Chile interviewed me and other microbiome experts about the project. The interview is online in YouTube (from minute 00:48 to 08:50). \n\n\n\n\n‘El Mercurio’, the largest Chilean newspaper, covered my research on the gut microbiome of South American populations. \n\n\n\n\nOpen Science: Transform your house into a laboratory\n\n\nA university news outlet covered the release of our science communication book. The book has instructions to perform simple scientific experiments and their explanations. It was released for free during the COVID-19 lockdown to encourage kids to learn about science. The book is free online (Spanish only)."

I’ve also served as a consultant and analyst in research projects involving multiomics biological data.\nI’m currently doing my PhD, where I’m focusing in developing and applying computational methods to better understand the microbiome-gut-brain axis. I work under the supervision of Professors John F. Cryan and Gerard Clarke at the APC microbiome Ireland.\nIn my daily life I like reading (mostly non-fiction), hiking, drinking coffee and doing 3D design and printing.\n\n\nResearch interests\nMy research focuses in three areas:\n\n\nMicrobiome modulation of the gut barrier integrity and its effects on host gut-brain health.\nThe gut microbiome of underrepresented population and its implications on brain health.\nProbiotics and Psychobiotics development."
