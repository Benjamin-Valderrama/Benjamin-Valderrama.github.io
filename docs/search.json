I’ve also served as a consultant and analyst in research projects involving multiomics biological data.\nI’m currently doing my PhD, where I’m focusing in developing and applying computational methods to better understand the microbiome-gut-brain axis. I work under the supervision of Professors John F. Cryan and Gerard Clarke at the APC microbiome Ireland.\nIn my daily life I like reading (mostly non-fiction), hiking, drinking coffee and doing 3D design and printing.\n\n\nResearch interests\nMy research focuses in three areas:\n\n\nMicrobiome modulation of the gut barrier integrity and its effects on host gut-brain health.\nThe gut microbiome of underrepresented population and its implications on brain health.\nProbiotics and Psychobiotics development."

    "text": "The South American Microbiome Archive (saMBA) is the largest archive of gut microbiome samples from South American populations analysed under an unified workflow. The main outputs generated while building saMBA can be downloaded from this Zenodo repository, and the analysis of those outputs is described in this article. The motivation to start this project is described here.\nNote that the workflow was made publicly available to propel microbiome research globally, specially in other neglected world regions. If interested in collaborating, please get in touch. Below there is a list of things I have in mind but I’m curious to see what you have to say.\n\nPlans for future developments\nBelow I share some ideas I’d like to implement to improve saMBA and to make it a useful resource for the entire community in the long run. I made this public to keep the users informed and to invite people interested in contributing in any of these points to reach out.\n\n\nBuild an R package to facilitate the download of the outputs in Zenodo\nImplement the workflow as a Docker image so users can deploy it.\n\nUpdate (01/Jun/2025): Docker image here\n\nExpand saMBA (the resource) to include samples from other bodysites of southamericans.\nExpand the workflow to include the analysis of projects using whole genome sequencing."

The interview is online in YouTube (from minute 00:48 to 08:50). \n\n\n\n\n‘El Mercurio’, the largest Chilean newspaper, covered my research on the gut microbiome of South American populations. \n\n\n\n\nOpen Science: Transform your house into a laboratory\n\n\nA university news outlet covered the release of our science communication book. The book has instructions to perform simple scientific experiments and their explanations. It was released for free during the COVID-19 lockdown to encourage kids to learn about science. The book is free online (Spanish only)."
