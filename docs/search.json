I work under the supervision of Professors John F. Cryan and Gerard Clarke at APC microbiome Ireland.\nSince my first year as an undergrad I have been working in the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Although I started doing molecular work, I transitioned to fully computational ðŸ’»ðŸ§¬ the year before starting my PhD, while still working in the industry.\nIn my daily life I like reading, hiking, drinking coffee and doing 3D design and printing.\n\n\nResearch interests\nMy research focuses in three key research areas:\n\n\nMicrobiome modulation of gut barrier integrity and its effects on host gut-brain health.\nThe study of the microbiome of underrepresented population and its implications on brain health.\nProbiotics and Psychobiotics development"

During those years I volunteered at a laboratory working on the microbiome-gut-brain axis using D. melanogaster as an animal model. On 2020 I did an extra year of training that is mandatory to work in Chilean industries. It is during this period when I discover my love for computational biology, while I was involved in the characterization of new probiotics for the aquaculture industry. On 2021 I had a small detour working as a automation specialist at a Chilean company, where I developed python scripts to control a pipeting robot. On 2022 I joined the APC microbiome Ireland to work as a bioinformatician and in 2023 I started my PhD under the supervision of Professors John F. Cryan and Gerard Clarke."

Note that while the workflow was deployed to build an archive of gut microbiome samples from South Americans, it can be used to build similar resources using samples from other bodysites or pupulations living in other neglected world regions. The motivation to start this project is described here.\nThe main outputs generated while building saMBA can be downloaded from this Zenodo repository. The analysis of those outputs is described in this preprint.\n\n\nPlans for future developments\nBelow I share some ideas Iâ€™d like to implement to improve saMBA and to make it a useful resource for the entire community in the long run. I made this public to keep the users informed and to invite people interested in contributing in any of these points to reach out.\n\n\nBuild an R package to facilitate the download of the outputs in Zenodo\nImplement the package using Snakemake and share it in Bioconda.\nExpand saMBA (the resource) to include samples from other bodysites of southamericans.\nExpand the workflow to include the analysis of projects using whole genome sequencing."
