    "text": "Short Bio\nI’m a Computational Biologist 💻🧬 with research experience in Academia, Industry, and their interface. I’ve also served as a consultant and analyst in research projects involving multiomics analysis of complex biological data.\nI’m currently doing my PhD, where I develop and apply computational methods to better understand the microbiome-gut-brain axis. I work under the supervision of Professors John F. Cryan and Gerard Clarke at the APC microbiome Ireland.\nIn my daily life I like reading books (mostly non-fiction), hiking, drinking coffee and doing 3D design and printing.\n\n\nResearch Interests\nMy research focuses in three areas:\n\n\nMicrobiome modulation of the gut barrier integrity and its effects on host gut-brain health.\nThe gut microbiome of underrepresented population and its implications on brain health.\nProbiotics and Psychobiotics development."

    "text": "The South American MicroBiome Archive (saMBA)\nThe South American Microbiome Archive (saMBA) is the largest archive of gut microbiome samples from South American populations analysed under an unified workflow.\nThe article describes the process of gathering and analysing the microbiome data, as well as the main findings. The harmonised dataset can be downloaded from Zenodo and the workflow used in the analysis is available on GitHub. All generated resources, including the article, are publicly available to propel microbiome research globally, specially in other neglected world regions.\nThe motivation to start this project is described here. If it resonated and you’re interested in collaborating, please get in touch.\n\n\nPlans for future developments\nBelow I share some ideas to expand saMBA. I made this public to keep the users informed and to invite people interested in contributing in any of these points to reach out.\n\n\nBuild an R package to facilitate the download of the outputs in Zenodo\nImplement the workflow as a Docker image so users can deploy it.\n\nUpdate (01/Jun/2025): Docker image here\n\nExpand saMBA (the resource) to include samples from other bodysites of southamericans.\nExpand the workflow to include the analysis of projects using whole genome sequencing."
