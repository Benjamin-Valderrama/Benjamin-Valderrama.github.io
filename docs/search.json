During those years I volunteered at a laboratory working on the microbiome-gut-brain axis using D. melanogaster as an animal model. On 2020 I did an extra year of training that is mandatory to work in Chilean industries. It is during this period when I discover my love for computational biology, while I was involved in the characterization of new probiotics for the aquaculture industry. On 2021 I had a small detour working as a automation specialist at a Chilean company, where I developed python scripts to control a pipeting robot. On 2022 I joined the APC microbiome Ireland to work as a bioinformatician and in 2023 I started my PhD under the supervision of Professors John F. Cryan and Gerard Clarke."

The main outputs generated while building saMBA can be downloaded from this Zenodo repository, and the analysis of those outputs is described in this article. The motivation to start this project is described here.\nNote that the workflow was made publicly available to propel microbiome research globally, specially in other neglected world regions. If interested in collaborating, please get in touch. Below there is a list of things I have in mind but I’m curious to see what you have to say.\n\nPlans for future developments\nBelow I share some ideas I’d like to implement to improve saMBA and to make it a useful resource for the entire community in the long run. I made this public to keep the users informed and to invite people interested in contributing in any of these points to reach out.\n\n\nBuild an R package to facilitate the download of the outputs in Zenodo\nImplement the workflow as a Docker image so users can deploy it.\n\nUpdate (01/Jun/2025): Docker image here\n\nExpand saMBA (the resource) to include samples from other bodysites of southamericans.\nExpand the workflow to include the analysis of projects using whole genome sequencing."
