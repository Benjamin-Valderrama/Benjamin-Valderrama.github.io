I work under the supervision of Professors John F. Cryan and Gerard Clarke at the APC microbiome Ireland.\nSince my first year as an undergrad I have been working in the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Although I started doing molecular work, I transitioned to fully computational :computer: :dna: the year before starting my PhD, while still working in the industry.\nIn my daily life I like reading, hiking, drinking coffee and doing 3D design and printing.\n\n\nResearch interests\nMy research focuses in using computational approaches to better understand the role of the gut microbiome in human health.
