## About me

I finished my 4 years-long bachelor degree in biology at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica of Chile in 2019. During those years I volunteered at a laboratory working on the microbiome-gut-brain axis using *D. melanogaster* as an animal model. On 2020 I did an extra year of training that is mandatory to work in Chilean industries. It is during this period when I discover my love for computational biology, while I was involved in the characterization of new probiotics for the aquaculture industry. On 2021 I had a small detour working as a automation specialist at a Chilean company, where I developed python scripts to control a pipeting robot. On 2022 I joined the APC microbiome Ireland to work as a bioinformatician and in 2023 I started my PhD under the supervision of Professors John F. Cryan and Gerard Clarke.

## Research interests

My research focuses in using computational approaches to better understand the role of the gut microbiome in human health. My three main research interests are:

-   Gut microbiome modulation of gut barrier integrity and its effects on host health

-   Expanding our understanding of the gut microbiome from underrepresented communities

-   Probiotic development
