The [South American Microbiome Archive (saMBA)]{.my_bold} is the largest archive of gut microbiome samples from South American populations analysed under an unified [workflow](https://github.com/Benjamin-Valderrama/saMBA-pipeline). The main outputs generated while building [saMBA]{.my_bold} can be downloaded from this [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15050380) repository, and the analysis of those outputs is described in this [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62601-4). The motivation to start this project is described [here](https://github.com/Benjamin-Valderrama/saMBA-pipeline/wiki/00.-About-the-project).

Note that the workflow was made publicly available to propel microbiome research globally, specially in other neglected world regions. If interested in collaborating, please get in touch. Below there is a list of things I have in mind but I'm curious to see what you have to say.

# Plans for future developments

Below I share some ideas I'd like to implement to improve saMBA and to make it a useful resource for the entire community in the long run. I made this public to keep the users informed and to invite people interested in contributing in any of these points to reach out.

::: bullet-list
-   Build an R package to facilitate the download of the outputs in Zenodo
-   ~~Implement the workflow as a Docker image so users can deploy it.~~
    -   [Update (01/Jun/2025)]{.my_bold}: Docker image [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bvalderrama/samba/general)
-   Expand [saMBA]{.my_bold} (the resource) to include samples from other bodysites of southamericans.
-   Expand the workflow to include the analysis of projects using whole genome sequencing.
